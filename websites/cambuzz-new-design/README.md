## Cambuzz new design using Google MDL
This is the source code for the Cambuzz new design. 

## Why go for a new design?
Our last design was based on quick hacks. We essentially wanted to know whether Cambuzz was capable to achieve product market fit. This new design is a fresh take on the holy grail of web design. Used material design principles.   

## History of the Project
Amidst late night maggi sessions, the idea of Cambuzz was born. 
Headquartered in VIT Chennai, cambuzz began as a side project and is now a tiny, bootstrapped idea helping the VIT Chennai family to share their events and is trying to become a go-to resource for discovering and connecting with everyone in the campus.

It has 3 sections:
* Buzz: Centralized information system for the campus. All events a.k.a buzz gets posted here notifying the students about the various events being organized in the campus.
* Track teacher: there is always a problem in tracking teacher in the huge campus. You enter the professor's name and it will show the cabin number and the slots when the teacher is free. 
* In campus Q/A forum Where students can ask a question and get answers to their queries.
Sort of quora but for campus.
